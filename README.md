Filled with sample case study, exercises, commonly faced issues/solutions, and important interview questions, this book is surely going to help developers to expand their skills in JPA.

This is the repository for [Mastering Java Persistence API (JPA)](https://bpbonline.com/products/mastering-java-persistence-api-jpa?_pos=1&_sid=f9123b936&_ss=r), published by BPB Publications
## About the Book
'Mastering Java Persistence API' is geared towards experiencing the functioning of JPA and the extent of its use in Java SE and Java EE applications. While the book's primary objective is to develop competence in JPA, it also takes a simpler approach to refresh readers on basic database management system concepts and how to design simple JPA applications.

The book begins with the ideas like ORM, EJB CMP, and the difficulties associated with data conversion from a database to an application and vice versa are handled spontaneously. The book discusses Table, Row, Column, Cell, and various forms of Relationships and progress sequentially through the JPA concepts. It also discusses database processes such as identity generation, sequencing, locking, querying, persisting, caching, and transaction management in detail and emphasizes how JPA handles them. Further, the book covers the architecture and setup of two of the most extensively used JPA provider implementations (Hibernate and EclipseLink) in detail. 

Additionally, this book includes sample functioning code for connecting to a MySQL database.
Each JPA functionality is illustrated with a code snippet, making it easier to modify these features as the application develops. This book teaches both beginners and seasoned professionals how to integrate JPA concepts in their employment through numerous problems and answers spanning each of the topics.
